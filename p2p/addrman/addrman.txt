How often should we expect nodes to go terrible 
Expecting nodes that should be marked as terrible 
should not say in addrman for more than 30 days 

Probability assumptions 
1. that the average addrman is 50,000 address both on tried and the new table.
2. that a feeler connection is how we mostly try to connect to new addresses
3. that the current checks in terrible are likely to never be true
4. that addresses are mostly marked as terrible it  by timestamps 

when will even attempt to connect to an address 10 times in a week --never 
what is the probability that a single address will ever have an attempt of 3 times even within a month
how do we primary get rid of offline addresses that we have received 


for the day 16th october 
Attempted feelers:703
Successful feelers:156
Received addr 1000: 30 


Calculate that the following are never true other than timestamps:
- bool AddrInfo::IsTerrible(NodeSeconds now) const
{
    //1.Do not remove an address that we have just attempted to connect to
    if (now - m_last_try <= 1min) { // never remove things tried in the last minute
        return false;
    }
    //2.Do remove an address that has a timestamp that is in the future
    if (nTime > now + 10min) { // came in a flying DeLorean
        return true;
    }
    //3.Do remove an address that is older than  a month 

    if (now - nTime > ADDRMAN_HORIZON) { // not seen in recent history
        return true;
    }
    //4.Do remoove an address that we have never sucessfuly connected to and that 
    // we have attempted to connected to alteast 3 times 
    if (TicksSinceEpoch<std::chrono::seconds>(m_last_success) == 0 && nAttempts >= ADDRMAN_RETRIES) { // tried N times and never a success
        return true;
    }
    //5. Do remove an address that the last sucessful conection is bigger than 
    // than a week ago and that we have failed to connect to atleast 10 times 
    if (now - m_last_success > ADDRMAN_MIN_FAIL && nAttempts >= ADDRMAN_MAX_FAILURES) { // N successive failures in the last week
        return true;
    }

    return false;

    //when is isterrible called 
    
}
