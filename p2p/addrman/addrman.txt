How often should we expect nodes to go terrible 
Expecting nodes that should be marked as terrible 
should not say in addrman for more than 30 days 

Probability assumptions 
1. that the average addrman is 50,000 address both on tried and the new table.
2. that a feeler connection is how we mostly try to connect to new addresses
3. that the current checks in terrible are likely to never be true
4. that addresses are mostly marked as terrible it  by timestamps 

when will even attempt to connect to an address 10 times in a week --never 
what is the probability that a single address will ever have an attempt of 3 times even within a month
how do we primary get rid of offline addresses that we have received
